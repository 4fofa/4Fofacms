intro:

  heading: What we offer
  text: Ten years ago, FOFA (Forth on Fourth Avenue) sponsored a community survey and stakeholder meeting to focus attention on and garner resources for our stretch of Brooklynâ€™s 4th Ave. Close to 400 people took the survey and we had a standing-room only crowd at the stakeholder meeting. Today, with dramatic physical changes along 4th Ave and adjacent neighborhoods, as well as a new population influx, we are again inviting community opinions and partnering with local organizations (like yours) to circulate a follow-up survey. Survey results will be tabulated and distributed prior to a public meeting on Wednesday May 15 at the Old Stone House. We are inviting elected officials, key city agencies and YOU to join us in the discussion at that meeting. This is your chance to express your views about 4th Ave. We need YOUR input!

  heading: Who We Are
  text: FOFA is a local community group that has been advocating for a safer,
    cleaner, greener, and more vibrant 4th Ave (from Times Plaza to Prospect
    Expressway) for over a decade. We, working with others, advocated for 4th
    Ave safety improvements (including the bike lane), for planting over 100
    trees (many with tree guards), for preservation of the Pacific Street
    Library, and for temporary art at the 4th Ave/9th St subway station. We have
    also sponsored clean-ups and tree bed planting - those daffodils on 4th Ave
    were planted by us and our friends!
