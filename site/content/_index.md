  heading: Who We Are
  text: FOFA is a local community group that has been advocating for a safer,
    cleaner, greener, and more vibrant 4th Ave (from Times Plaza to Prospect
    Expressway) for over a decade. We, working with others, advocated for 4th
    Ave safety improvements (including the bike lane), for planting over 100
    trees (many with tree guards), for preservation of the Pacific Street
    Library, and for temporary art at the 4th Ave/9th St subway station. We have
    also sponsored clean-ups and tree bed planting - those daffodils on 4th Ave
    were planted by us and our friends!
